# Car Price Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, horsepower, and other relevant factors. The goal is to understand the key drivers of car prices and provide insights into how different features impact pricing. The analysis leverages machine learning models and data visualization techniques to uncover trends and predict car prices.
